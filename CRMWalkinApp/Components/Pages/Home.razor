<h3>Welcome to CRM Walkin (Server-Side Blazor)</h3>

<!-- If you want to replicate your login flow with Firebase Auth
     in a purely server-side environment, you have to implement
     your own auth or handle Firestore-based user records.
     If you used Firebase Auth’s client-based approach,
     you might consider storing user accounts on the server.
     For demonstration, we'll skip the details. -->
